elonmusk,2021-06-13,"@Cointelegraph This is inaccurate. Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market.  When there‚Äôs confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions."

elonmusk,2021-05-24,Spoke with North American Bitcoin miners. They committed to publish current &amp; planned renewable usage &amp; to ask miners WW to do so. Potentially promising.
elonmusk,2021-05-20,@TeslaGong @wintonARK Bitcoin hashing (aka mining) energy usage is starting to exceed that of medium-sized countries. Almost impossible for small hashers to succeed without those massive economies of scale.
elonmusk,2021-05-17,"@BTC_Archive To clarify speculation, Tesla has not sold any Bitcoin"
elonmusk,2021-05-16,"@ChainLinkGod @PeterMcCormack Bitcoin is actually highly centralized, with supermajority controlled by handful of big mining (aka hashing) companies.   A single coal mine in Xinjiang flooded, almost killing miners, and Bitcoin hash rate dropped 35%. Sound ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù to you?   https://t.co/Oom8yzGRNQ"

elonmusk,2021-04-26,"@stoolpresidente No, you do not. I have not sold any of my Bitcoin. Tesla sold 10% of its holdings essentially to prove liquidity of Bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on balance sheet."
elonmusk,2021-03-24,Pay by Bitcoin capability available outside US later this year
elonmusk,2021-03-24,"Tesla is using only internal &amp; open source software &amp; operates Bitcoin nodes directly.  Bitcoin paid to Tesla will be retained as Bitcoin, not converted to fiat currency."
elonmusk,2021-03-24,You can now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin
elonmusk,2021-03-12,BTC (Bitcoin) is an anagram of TBC(The Boring Company) What a coincidence!
elonmusk,2021-02-19,"@business To be clear, I am *not* an investor, I am an engineer. I don‚Äôt even own any publicly traded stock besides Tesla.   However, when fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn‚Äôt look elsewhere.   Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money. The key word is ‚Äúalmost‚Äù."
elonmusk,2021-02-19,"@business Tesla‚Äôs action is not directly reflective of my opinion. Having some Bitcoin, which is simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash, is adventurous enough for an S&amp;P500 company."
